/// slot fits entirely inside the usable area (right of the notch). This one is
/// hundreds of points wide by design, so it always overlaps the notch and is
/// always invisible — measured by filling it with 80 glyphs and seeing none of
/// them. That is fine. Occupying width is its whole job; `Handle` is the part
/// the user sees and clicks.
