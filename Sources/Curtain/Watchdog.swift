/// it there and never checked. Nothing tells the user; the icon is just gone.

/// Curtain cannot always fix that (an item right of the line is beyond our

    /// overlapping the line's own span. Deliberately hidden is `.hidden`, off the
    /// left edge entirely; anything merely lost in the notch is worth saying out
